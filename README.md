## Palladium

A standard GH noteskin that will look and feel familiar to GH and CH veterans. Cool features include:  
* 3D models with spheremapped textures, looks good from any angle  
* Colors are easily customized by editing the table at the top of NoteSkin.lua  
* Easily identifiable notetypes with color, animation, and a variety of materials

*Coming eventually: holds that can be recolored instead of using the default note colors*

## Palladium-Focus

A variation of Palladium meant for mod files, the UI elements at the edges of the notefield are replaced with indicator rings around the receptors that convey information:  
* white = <10 combos, x1 multiplier  
* orange = 10-20 combos, x2 multiplier  
* green = 20-30 combos, x3 multiplier  
* purple = 30+ combos, x4 multiplier  
* pulsing = fever ready to activate!

-----

## Palladium-Quantum

A variation of Palladium that uses colors to indicate beat quantizations instead of column. These colors can be adjust similar to the standard Palladium noteskin. Activating fever does not change the note colors, but other effects will make it obvious when fever is active
